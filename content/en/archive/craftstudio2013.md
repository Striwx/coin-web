This event was the first seminar organized with our partner, [EPITECH Nancy](http://nancy.epitech.eu/). [CraftStudio](http://craftstud.io/) is a collaborative game making tool. During this event, the creator of this tool, [Élisée Maurer](https://twitter.com/elisee) tell us what led him when he was only 22 years old to start his own business and to develop his project thanks to crowdfunding. Then we discovered the CraftStudio tool and we could interact in realtime on the design of a game.

## Where and When?
The CraftStudio seminar took place in Nancy (France), at the EPITECH premises the 6 of June 2013 at 7pm.
